# Trueo

A mindful, minimal, and inclusive social media application.

**Trueo** is a mindful, minimal, and inclusive social media application where users control their feed by choosing topics that matter to them.  
Built to **reduce noise**, the platform uses **AI** to filter out propaganda while highlighting **under-reported realities** from around the world — creating a **truthful, distraction-free space** for meaningful connection.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is **currently in development**.

## 🗂️ Monorepo Structure

Trueo is organized as a **monorepo** using **pnpm workspaces**:

- **Frontend** → Next.js (React, TailwindCSS)  
- **Backend** → Node.js with Express  
- Shared dependencies managed at the root with pnpm  

## ✨ Key Features (in progress)

* 🧘 **Minimal & Inclusive UI** – a clean, distraction-free design.
* 🎯 **Topic-based Feeds** – users choose what they want to see.
* 🤖 **AI-Powered Filtering** – reduces propaganda, noise, and bias.
* 🌍 **Truth-Centric** – highlights overlooked realities and global issues.
* ⚡ **Scalable Architecture** – monorepo with modern tooling.

## 🌱 Vision

Trueo is built on a simple belief:  
**social media should empower, not overwhelm.**

Today’s platforms amplify noise, controversy, and propaganda — leaving truth buried under algorithms that prioritize engagement over authenticity.

Trueo reimagines social media as:

* A **mindful space** where users set the tone of their feeds.
* An **inclusive platform** where all voices matter without being drowned out.
* A **truth-first network** that elevates under-reported realities.
* A tool for **clarity, not distraction**.

Our goal is not to replace connection with consumption — but to create a **digital space where attention is respected, and truth is valued.**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
